	"content": "Protect against malware and ransomware By following these security controls, you will be significantly reducing your exposure to malware and ransomware.\nFirst is frequent backups Content\rIf your system has been compromised by malware or ransomware, you may have lost access to some or all of the data on that system. If you\u0026rsquo;ve been keeping frequent data backups however, the impact goes from possibly devastating to merely inconvenient. Simply restore the backed up data onto an uninfected system. Backing up your data is especially important to recover from ransomware attacks that specifically target your data. Also make sure you test your backups. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to attempt restoring your backups in an emergency only to find they\u0026rsquo;re corrupted or not complete.\nApply security updates and patches. Content\rMalware and ransomware can only work on systems that are vulnerable to their attacks. You can significantly reduce your exposure to malware and ransomware attacks by making sure your systems have all their security updates and patches.\nUpgrade to the latest operating system versions Content\rIf you\u0026rsquo;ve been putting off the expense or hassle of upgrading your operating systems to their most current versions, you could be exposing yourself to vulnerabilities that don\u0026rsquo;t have patches. Plus, current operating systems are often designed to be more secure than previous versions.\nInstall firewall Content\rFirewalls are designed to prevent unauthorized traffic from getting directly to your systems. Many forms of malware attempt to exploit systems that are directly connected to the internet without a firewall. There are also types of malware that once installed, attempt to communicate with a command and control system outside of the infected network. Hardware and software firewalls can block these malicious traffic flows.\nInstall anti malware software Content\rNo matter how much you try to protect your network and systems, malware can still be introduced by accident if a user becomes a victim of social engineering. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s important to install antimalware software on all systems, and make sure the malware signatures are updated at least daily.\nExplore the threat of malware and ransomware MALWARE Malware is a catchall term for any software that is designed to gain unauthorized access to computers or network equipment with the goals of causing damage, extracting information, or making money for the attackers. Malware can take on many forms, including viruses, worms, Trojans, rootkits, adware, and spyware. A growing form of malware attack is known as cryptojacking. A growing form of malware attack is known as cryptojacking. This malware variant exploits a vulnerable computer and uses its resources to mine cryptocurrency. There are two main ways that systems become infected with malware. These are flaws in hardware or software that allow malware to get installed and function. Usually, patches exist to fix these vulnerabilities, but users and organizations don\u0026rsquo;t always apply these patches in a timely manner, leaving themselves exposed. And even old vulnerabilities are still targeted by malware attackers. The second most common way that systems get infected with malware is users falling prey to social engineering. This happens when attackers successfully convince a user to download infected software, open an infected email attachment, or connect an infected disk or drive. The system still needs to be vulnerable to the malware that the user introduces for it to work though. RANSOMEWARE Ransomware is a form of malware that has a special purpose. It encrypts data and files on the infected computer and instructs the user to send the attackers money to recover their information. In some cases, attackers will also steal files from the victim\u0026rsquo;s systems and threaten to expose these files to the public to increase the pressure to pay. This is known as double extortion. Ransomware can be a lucrative income for attackers. Ransomware can use any of the malware attack techniques, one of the most common is the fake urgent email with a malicious link or attachment designed to trick users to click the link or open the attachment.

	"content": " Protect against phishing and smishing Let\u0026rsquo;s look at five steps you can take which can reduce your exposure to the threat of phishing.\nExpand content\rFirst, implement email filtering controls. Since phishing uses malicious emails, the better you get at blocking them, the more you\u0026rsquo;ll be protecting yourself and your organization. Users can control emails at their inbox by flagging unwanted and suspicious emails as junk.\nOrganizations can also block suspicious emails at the email server by blacklisting known malicious email servers and even blocking emails from entire countries, domains, or IP address ranges. Many email servers have additional controls designed to identify and block malicious emails.\nExpand content\rThe next way to protect against phishing is to block access to fraudulent and malicious websites. This can be done at the user level by accessing the internet only with web browsers that show a warning if users attempt to go to a fraudulent site. Most modern browsers have security settings that can be configured to do this. Also organizations can install firewalls or proxy servers that prevent users from accessing known bad websites\nExpand content\rThe third step you can take is to use a password manager. This is a digital safe that can generate and store strong and unique passwords for any site that needs one. That way you\u0026rsquo;re not reusing the same passwords on different websites. So even if one of your passwords gets compromised in a phishing attack, it won\u0026rsquo;t work anywhere else.\nExpand content\rFourth is multifactor authentication. This is a stronger form of authentication than just passwords. It requires a password plus at least a device you have or a biometric factor like a fingerprint. That way even if the attacker gets your username and password, they can\u0026rsquo;t log in without the other factor.\nExpand content\rFinally, we have security training. If users know not to open phishing emails and click on manipulated links, phishing wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be such a serious problem. Teach users how to recognize phishing attacks. Explain why they should be suspicious of urgent emails and how to hover over links to see if they\u0026rsquo;re legitimate or not.\nExplore the threat of phishing and smishing Phishing and smishing are social engineering attacks designed to trick users into sharing sensitive personal information, like usernames, passwords, and credit card details with attackers\nLet\u0026#39;s take a look at what these threats are and how they work.\rPhishing has been around since the 1990s, but it\u0026rsquo;s still going strong. IBM Security X-Force reported that phishing was the top method of compromise in 2022. The most common phishing technique is to send a fraudulent email to a targeted user. The email is designed to look like it came from a trusted entity and it will often appear urgent, so the recipient will quickly open it. Typically, the email will contain a manipulated link that looks like it goes to a real website. If the user clicks the link, though, it goes to a forged website designed to look like the real thing. Once there, the target will usually be prompted to enter their username and password for the site. If they do, the attacker will now have their credentials for the real site. Depending on the site, this can turn into an immediate loss of information or money for the victim.\nIn some cases, the phishing email won\u0026rsquo;t have a link. It will have a malicious attachment. If the recipient clicks on the attachment, it will often attempt to install ransomware,\nOne of the keys to a successful phishing attack is making the emails look like they came from trusted sources. So phishing attackers frequently co-op trusted brands like Microsoft, Apple, Google, Chase, and Amazon.\nPhishing email subject lines often have a certain style. Here are examples of typical subject lines used in phishing emails.\nNote, how they sound urgent or at least important enough to not ignore.\rSpear phishing is a variety of phishing that customizes email attacks to specific users, hoping the illusion of familiarity will create more trust.\nThe attackers send SMS texts to the victim\u0026#39;s phone.\rSmishing has many of the same characteristics of phishing, but instead of sending fraudulent emails, the attackers send SMS texts to the victim\u0026rsquo;s phone. Common smishing text messages often impersonate a bank with an urgent message about how your account has been locked due to suspicious activity, or a recent payment was made and the bank needs your confirmation. Then there\u0026rsquo;s usually a link to a malicious site designed to steal your online banking credentials.\nSmishing scams can also include text messages about winning a prize that you have to redeem through a website.\rYou should immediately be suspicious of getting anything for free through a text message.\nAnother form of smishing includes text messages impersonating someone you work with, like your boss or the CEO of your company\rThreat actors can easily find the company you work for and get your cellphone number to pull off this attack. They\u0026rsquo;ll send a text message, pretending to be your boss or CEO, and ask you to help them with a task. The task often requires you to buy gift cards to give to employees or clients. If you buy the cards, the attackers will ask you to send them the codes, which will allow them to instantly extract the money off the cards.\nBecause both phishing and smishing attacks are cheap, simple, and effective, we can expect that they will continue to be among the most common attacks on the cybersecurity threat landscape.\n"
