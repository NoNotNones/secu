#### Protect against malware and ransomware

By following these security controls, you will be significantly reducing your exposure to malware and ransomware.

1. First is frequent backups 

![21][6]

{{%expand "Content" %}}
If your system has been compromised by malware or ransomware, you may have lost access to some or all of the data on that system. If you've been keeping frequent data backups however, the impact goes from possibly devastating to merely inconvenient. Simply restore the backed up data onto an uninfected system. Backing up your data is especially important to recover from ransomware attacks that specifically target your data. Also make sure you test your backups. You don't want to attempt restoring your backups in an emergency only to find they're corrupted or not complete.

Malware and ransomware can only work on systems that are vulnerable to their attacks. You can significantly reduce your exposure to malware and ransomware attacks by making sure your systems have all their security updates and patches.

3. Upgrade to the latest operating system versions  ![21][8]

 If you've been putting off the expense or hassle of upgrading your operating systems to their most current versions, you could be exposing yourself to vulnerabilities that don't have patches.  Plus, current operating systems are often designed to be more secure than previous versions.

4. Install firewall  ![21][9]

{{%expand "Content" %}}
Firewalls are designed to prevent unauthorized traffic from getting directly to your systems. Many forms of malware attempt to exploit systems that are directly connected to the internet without a firewall. There are also types of malware that once installed, attempt to communicate with a command and control system outside of the infected network. Hardware and software firewalls can block these malicious traffic flows.

5. Install anti malware software ![21][10]

{{%expand "Content" %}}
No matter how much you try to protect your network and systems, malware can still be introduced by accident if a user becomes a victim of social engineering. That's why it's important to install antimalware software on all systems, and make sure the malware signatures are updated at least daily.

#### Explore the threat of malware and ransomware

##### MALWARE

- Malware is a catchall term for any software that is designed to gain unauthorized access to computers or network equipment with the goals of causing damage, extracting information, or making money for the attackers.
- Malware can take on many forms, including viruses, worms, Trojans, rootkits, adware, and spyware. A growing form of malware attack is known as cryptojacking.

![21][1]

- A growing form of malware attack is known as cryptojacking. This malware variant exploits a vulnerable computer and uses its resources to mine cryptocurrency.

![21][2]

- There are two main ways that systems become infected with malware.
  - These are flaws in hardware or software that allow malware to get installed and function. Usually, patches exist to fix these vulnerabilities, but users and organizations don't always apply these patches in a timely manner, leaving themselves exposed. And even old vulnerabilities are still targeted by malware attackers.  ![21][3]
  - The second most common way that systems get infected with malware is users falling prey to social engineering. This happens when attackers successfully convince a user to download infected software, open an infected email attachment, or connect an infected disk or drive. The system still needs to be vulnerable to the malware that the user introduces for it to work though. ![21][4]

##### RANSOMEWARE
- Ransomware is a form of malware that has a special purpose. It encrypts data and files on the infected computer and instructs the user to send the attackers money to recover their information. In some cases, attackers will also steal files from the victim's systems and threaten to expose these files to the public to increase the pressure to pay. This is known as double extortion. Ransomware can be a lucrative income for attackers.
- Ransomware can use any of the malware attack techniques, one of the most common is the fake urgent email with a malicious link or attachment designed to trick users to click the link or open the attachment. ![21][5]
